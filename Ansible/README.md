### Ansible sequency

- `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` variable
- ./ansible.cfg
- ~/.ansible.cfg
- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

### What is ansible.cfg ?
Default configuration file of Ansible; normally, you don't change this file
Example ansible.cfg

### Commands 

```
$ ansible all --list-hosts` list all hosts recognized by ansible

$ ansible ungrouped --list-hosts` list all hosts without group

$ ansible <host-or-group> -i <archive> --list-hosts` list hosts 

$ ansible-inventory -v -i <archive> --graph` list all tree of hosts 

$ ansible --version` list the version and the configuration archive

$ ansible-config list` show all modules in use 

$ ansible-doc list` show all modules in use 
```

### Modules => Tasks => Plays => Playbook.

Let us see buidlding blocks about Ansible:

- **Inventory:** It is a simple list of hosts; /etc/ansible/hosts
- **Playbook or commands:** Execution of desired actions.
- **API:** Cloud Services
- **SSH, WinRM:** Work via transport layer.
- **Ansible roles:** Special kind of playbook that are fully self-contained with tasks, variables, configurations templates and other supporting files.
- **Ansible Galaxy:** Like git repo,collection of playbooks available as open source.
- **Ansible Tower:** Ansible Tower is a web-based interface for managing Ansible.
- **Ansible AWX:** It is the open source version of Ansible Tower & a web-based solution that makes Ansible even more easy to use for IT teams of all kinds. Itâ€™s designed to be the hub for all of your automation tasks. Simple, Powerful and agentless (unlike Puppet).

### Module

- **AD HOC** command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes.

- **Module** a program (usually python) that executes, does some work and returns proper JSON output
Example of modules:  
  - Module: `ping` - the simplest module that is useful to verify host connectivity
  - Module: `shell` - a module that executes shell command on a specified host(s)

  ```
  $ ansible -m ping all
  $ ansible -m shell -a 'date; whoami' localhost #hostname_or_a_group_name

  ```
  - Module: `command` - executes a single command that will not be processed through the shell
  -  `ansible all -m <command>`  
  -  `ansible all -m setup`  list inventory
  -  `ansible all -m setup` show inventory 
  -  `ansible all -m setup -a "filter=ansible_default_ipv4"` show inventory and a specific information 
  -  `ansible all -m copy -a "src=./ansible.cfg dest=/tmp mode=644 owner=vagrant"` copy localhost to guest
  -  `ansible-config list -t <module>` show especific module in use like **ansible-config list -t become**
  - `ansible-config init > ansible.cfg` sent a new ansible file with all configurations
  - `-k` ask the password 
  - `-b` elevate privilegies
  - `-K` ask the password to elevate privilegies
  - `-v` verbose
  - `ansible all -m shell -a "/sbin/reboot" -b` reboot vms
  - `ansible all -m systemd -a "name=sshd state=restarted" -b` restart services
